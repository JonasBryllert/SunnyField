		<hr/>
		Sunny Field is located north of Dublin between Swords and Ashbourne in an area called
		Boggyheary, Kilsallaghan. Sunny Field is one acre large and surrounded by an organic farm.
		<p>The house is a dormer bungalow and was built in 2007. It is a Swedish house and built
		to nearly passive standard. The sun sets over the large patio on the west side.</p>
		<p>The garden is mostly grass surrounded on three sides by hedges. In the north and east
		trees of type alder, ash and willow have been planted to form a wind shelter.</p>
		<p>The west side of the garden has many fruit trees (apple, plum, pear and cherry). 
		There is an enclosed vegetable garden with fruit bushes like currants, blue berry and 
		goose berry.</p>

					erected by Scandinavian Homes in four days. The shell included
					the outer walls with windows and doors, and the roof except roof tiles.</p>
					The house was then finished in less than four months by
					carpenter Francis Day. He also built the garage.
