		<p>A goldfish was too simple, a dog too hard so we decided to get three hens!</p>
		<p>Yes, we bought a small chicken coup with three hens aged 16 weeks. According to the seller we should be getting fresh eggs
		in about five weeks. We have also managed to put up a small run of 3x3 meter and 4 feet high. We immediately found out that hens
		can fly...</p>
		<p>So far I have to say that hens are great pets. Our daughter is delighted and feeds them, pets them and
		lets them in/out in the morning/evening. They are surprisingly nice and don't seem to mind being handled 
		and lifted up.</p>
